##Start by modifying the KP constant and get the performance as good as you can before moving onto KD and then finally KI.
##If the motor adjustments are too aggressive, swinging between too fast and too slow, reduce the constant.
##   If the motor speed isnâ€™t changing fast enough, increase the constant.
##  Make any change in small increments; even a very small change can have a dramatic effect.
